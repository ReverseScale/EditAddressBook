# EditAddressBook
Multi-section tableView address book, support single selection, multiple selection, batch deletion, etc.

```swift
var testArray = ["王老二", "谢老三", "李老四", "徐老五", "张老六", "鲁老七", "陈老八", "习老九", "武老十", "赵十一", "周十二", "吴十三", "孔十四", "韦十五", "任十六", "花十七", "宋十八", "杜十九", "丁二十", "叶二一", "艾二二", "苗二三"]
```

Most of the editable native TableViews on the Internet are single-section, and the data source is also required to be dictionary-array nested. By drawing on the open source sorting method, the loaded array data output grouping TableView is sorted out, and single/all-selection deletion is supported. operating.

The code is rough, please forgive me.
